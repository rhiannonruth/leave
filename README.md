# *LEAVE*
LEAVE. is a mobile app that notifies a user when to leave based on their desired arrival time and live travel and weather updates. A user selects start and end stations, then a call is made to the API (see [LEAVE API](https://github.com/rhiannonruth/leave-api)) and a notification is automatically created on their phone.
